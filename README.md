Plugin API
----------
To add dropzone capability to arbitrary field types you can use the `acf_dropzone/file_fields` and `acf_dropzone/gallery_fields` filter.

This might come in handy if you use the feature image field type of [ACF Frontend](https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-frontend-form-element/), or something alike.

Adding support for ACF Frontendâ€˜s `featured_image` field:
```php
add_filter( 'acf_dropzone/file_fields', function($fields) {
	$fields[] = 'featured_image';
	return $fields;
});
```

Please note that the field input HTML needs to be exactly as the one provided by ACF, so filters won't work on any field.
